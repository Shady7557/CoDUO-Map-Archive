# CoDUO-Map-Archive
An archive of custom (user-made) maps for Call of Duty: United Offensive.

I did not create any of these maps. All credit goes to the original users who made these custom maps.

Unfortunately, most of these maps have disappeared from online websites and can no longer be downloaded, as most of those old websites have gone offline in the past couple of years. The only way to acquire them is to grab them from people who still have the maps downloaded, or from servers that still exist for the game that still host these maps. Both are growing increasingly thin.

If you have maps you want archived, please submit them.

Finally, if you like this, you may also be interested in my application, [CoDUO FoV Changer](https://github.com/Shady7557/CoDUO-FoV-Changer) which allows you to change your Field of View so that playing widescreen resolutions in Multiplayer is actually feasible.
