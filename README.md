# NOTE: Do not play on RA (Rebel Alliance) if you play Call of Duty: United Offensive's multiplayer.

They will ban you permanently for joining their server without having been given explicit permission to play there.
Ban appeals will be ignored; the channels are purely facades. It is also *potentially dangerous*, as with every server you join, your public IP address is visible to server administrators.
**They demonstrated that they will publicly mention your IP's geolocation as well as past names,** ***even real names.***

For a safe space in United Offensive, please consider joining our Discord. Players will be treated with utmost kindness, patience, and respect. 
They will not be quickly banned unless their behavior is extreme or they are cheating in-game. Ban appeals will be promptly reviewed:

[Empire / CODUO NA Competitive Discord](https://discord.gg/tAsTyVQDjz)

To RA's very own ***StarKiller*** (you asked *me* for this repo, then let us be banned without any given reason & ignored appeals), 
*you know what to do and how to resolve this issue.*

# CoDUO-Map-Archive

An archive of custom (user-made) maps for Call of Duty: United Offensive.

I did not create any of these maps. All credit goes to the original users who made these custom maps.

Unfortunately, most of these maps have disappeared from online websites and can no longer be downloaded, as most of those old websites have gone offline in the past couple of years. The only way to acquire them is to grab them from people who still have the maps downloaded, or from servers that still exist for the game that still host these maps. Both are growing increasingly thin.

If you have maps you want archived, please submit them.

Finally, if you like this, you may also be interested in my application, [CoDUO FoV Changer](https://github.com/Shady7557/CoDUO-FoV-Changer) which allows you to change your Field of View so that playing widescreen resolutions in Multiplayer is actually feasible.
