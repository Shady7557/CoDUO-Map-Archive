# WARNING: Concerning the RA (Rebel Alliance) server, please read if you play Call of Duty: United Offensive's multiplayer.

There are other *(secure!)* servers than RA to play on. They are not all compromised, and the game itself is ultimately alive and safe to play.
Sadly, most servers will have fewer players active than RA. Alternatives are sprouting up, and it is ultimately our goal to keep the game alive, well, and **safe.**
Please exercise caution and beware that not all servers have well-meaning administrators and that, worse than banning you, they may take things a step further (see below).

They will likely ban you permanently for joining their server without having been given explicit permission to play there.
Ban appeals will be ignored; the channels are purely facades. Recently, they disabled all invites to Discord and thus ***making an appeal is impossible***. It is also *potentially dangerous*, as with every server you join, your public IP address is visible to server administrators.
**They demonstrated that they will publicly mention your IP's geolocation as well as past names,** ***even real names.***
Users who join with a VPN active will be coerced into ultimately giving up some sort of identity at the threat of being banned. 
They're quick to do this because their ban list is extensive, and **they suspect people are ban evading simply for using a VPN.**

For a safe space in United Offensive, please consider joining our Discord. Players will be treated with utmost kindness, patience, and respect. 
They will not be quickly banned unless their behavior is extreme or they are cheating in-game. Ban appeals will be promptly reviewed:

[Empire / CODUO NA Competitive Discord](https://discord.gg/tAsTyVQDjz)

To RA's very own ***StarKiller*** (you asked *me* for the map repo, then let us be banned without any given reason & ignored appeals), 
*you know what to do and how to resolve this issue.*

# CoDUO-Map-Archive

An archive of custom (user-made) maps for Call of Duty: United Offensive.

I did not create any of these maps. All credit goes to the original users who made these custom maps.

Unfortunately, most of these maps have disappeared from online websites and can no longer be downloaded, as most of those old websites have gone offline in the past couple of years. The only way to acquire them is to grab them from people who still have the maps downloaded, or from servers that still exist for the game that still host these maps. Both are growing increasingly thin.

If you have maps you want archived, please submit them.

Finally, if you like this, you may also be interested in my application, [CoDUO FoV Changer](https://github.com/Shady7557/CoDUO-FoV-Changer) which allows you to change your Field of View so that playing widescreen resolutions in Multiplayer is actually feasible.
